1. This project is not something that came out of necessity.
2. So, I don't have a clear picture how the end system must look like.
3. But, for most of the living being have this desire to not fall for death.
4. If we loose some one to it, we mourne.
5. With this project, I am planning to keep our connection with them prevailing.
6. I am no expert in neither of the fields that's capable for it.
7. So, I intend to create a simulated environment.
8. This simulated environment may be a place where the person should be.
9. So, I think there needs to be some tool that can model physical places that is similar as we see in a movie.
10. I am not sure if such precision is possible.
11. Feels like I am stuck here.
12. Is deep fake a suitable option here?
13. But, what exactly is a deep fake?
14. Ok. Now assume if such a system is realised. What's next?
15. Then, this simulated entities should be programmatically updated.
16. But that should be not according to a predefined rules.
17. But, I don't think that's a easy catch. Might need long dev cycles.
18. I think it is better design the process such that it responds to predefined rules and some fake consiousness with less coupling.
19. This time I get the idea of Sophia.
